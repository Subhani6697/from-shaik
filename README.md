###### Cricket is my favorite sport

For me, cricket is more than just a game. It teaches me discipline, teamwork, and the importance of hard work. Every match is a new learning experience. The excitement of cricket is unmatched. Whether it’s a fast-paced T20 match or a strategic test match, every game is unique and enjoyable. That’s why I love cricket.
